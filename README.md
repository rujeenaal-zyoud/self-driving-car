# self-driving-car
 by apply computer vision to processing the images , deep learning using CNN to create the model , for  automotive regression problem that  was steering car by angle value .Using UDACITY simulator  to see the results
 
 
 need to learn :
1- Deep learning 
using cnn to create the model with low loss and high accuracy  to solve difficlit problem like classifiction and regression 
2- open cv 
To proccessing the imagr in dataset
